========================================================================
mcti:   A program to calculate the titration behavior of a
	large number of interacting residues in a protein.
========================================================================
Program mcti calculates, as a function of pH, the average protonation
for a set of interacting residues in a protein by using a Monte Carlo
sampling of the protonation states.  Details of the method and applications
can be found in Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA), 88, 5804-5808 (July 1991).

To get started you need to:
	1. IMPORTANT:  Because random number generators vary from machine 
	    to machine, it will be necessary to replace calls to
	    the random number seed function and generator function
	    in order to use your local random number generator.  
	    Modify the calls to the random number seed and generator
	    functions to call your local random number generator.
	2. redefine the FOR variable in makefile to be your local compiler
	3. make: compiles the program (you can do this by hand for
	    non-UNIX systems)
	4. runmc: a shell script to run the program (this can also
	    be done by hand for non-UNIX systems).

************************ INPUT FILES **********************************
- sample.pkint is a formatted file containing
the residues and their intrinsic pKa's (the pKa the residue
has when all other titrating sites are in their neutral state).
The format is (f10.5,1x,a1,1x,a3,2x,i4): the first entry is the 
intrinsic pKa; the second entry identifies the site as either 
anionic (A- + H+ => AH) or cationic (A + H+ => AH+);  the third and
fourth entries are the residue's name and number.
- sample.g is a file containing site-site interactions between
the titrating sites.  The file is read in free-format.  The first
two entries are the residue numbers and the third entry is
their interaction.  The file is twice as long as it needs to be
(i.e., there are identical interactions for i,j and j,i).
The units of the interaction is e*e/Angtrom, where e is the magnitude
of the electronic charge).
*************************** OPTIONS ******************************************
I have numbered the lines of the shell script to describe the input options:
 1) mcti <<EOF >sample.out
 2) sample.pkint
 3) sample.g
 4) 500
 5) 1000
 6) 7.0
 7) 7.0
 8) 1.0
 9) 2.0
10) 0.000001
11) 0
12) 1
13) sample.log
14) EOF

Definitions:
 1) command line
 2) input file for intrinsic pKa's
 3) input file for site-site interactions
 4) nfull: Number of full Monte Carlo steps  (see below)
 5) nreduced: Number of reduced Monte Carlo steps  (see below)
 6) starting pH value
 7) ending pH value
 8) pH increment
 9) redmc_toler: minimum interaction for pairing of sites (see below)
10) cutoff for reduced Monte Carlo (see below)
11) random number seed: 0="random" starting seed derived from
a system call for the date. Any other integer here will be used
for the seed value for the random number generator.
12) Flag for running Monte Carlo on a reduced set of sites
    (0=full Monte Carlo only; 1=reduced Monte Carlo)
**************************************************************************
2-site Transitions:
To improve sampling efficiency, simultaneous two-site transitions
are allowed for pairs of strongly interacting sites.  
"Strong" is defined by item #9 (pair cutoff) in the script above.
The pair cutoff is in pK units, and if sites have an interaction
greater than this value, they are considered a strongly-interacting
pair. Changes of pair protonation states are attempted, on average,
as often as single-site transitions.
**************************************************************************
Full and Reduced Monte Carlo:
The full Monte Carlo sampling is the sampling described in the PNAS paper.  
Reduced Monte Carlo sampling is an approximation scheme to improve speed.
If you have no need for faster calculations set item #12 (the reduced
monte carlo flag) to 0, and forget about the rest of this section.
If you want to speed things up, used reduced monte carlo.
The idea is simple.  First, run Monte Carlo on the full system.
Then, after nfull monte carlo steps,  calculate the average
protonation for each residue.  If the protonation is 
close to 0 or 1 for a site (where close" is defined as within 
redmc_toler of either 0 or 1), then the protonation state of that
residue is held fixed.  All the fixed residues are now part of the
non-titrating part of the protein.  For the non-fixed residues,
the Monte Carlo sampling will continue, with the the 
influence of the fixed sites as an external field.
Item # 12 in the script above specifies how the sampling should be
done:  0=standard full monte carlo for (item #4) Monte Carlo steps.
1=standard full monte carlo for (item #4) Monte Carlo steps, followed
by (item #5) Monte Carlo steps on a reduced set of sites.
Sites are held fixed if their average protonation as calculated
by the full monte carlo is within (item #10) of 0 or one.
The results of the full monte carlo are written to the log file
and the reduced monte carlo results are written to the output file.
The two results should be compared to insure that the approximation
introduced does not significantly change the average protonation
of any site.

I hope you find the program useful.  If you have any questions, suggestions,
bug reports, etc.  please send them along to

Also, if you would email me a couple lines describing the application 
of this program to your research, I would appreciate it.

Good luck,
